        <h1>My Home</h1>
        <p class="darkblue"> Welcome to my website! Here you'll learn a little about me and my home. My name is Florence
            Frederick-Cintron. Currently, I am an elementary school teacher. I am also pursuing my MLIS Degree to become
            a librarian.
            The Virgin Islands consist of four islands. They are St. Croix, St. John, St. Thomas, and Water Island. St.
            Criox is the
            largest. Each island has its uniqueness that depends on what a vistor is looking for.All four islands
            are filled with crystal clear blue beaches and white sands. I live on the islands of St. Thomas. The
            capital of the Virgin Islands is Charlotte Amaile. St. Croix has two towns, Frederiksted and
            Christensted. St. John as one town, Cruz Bay. All four island have many unique and diverse activites to
            engage in. Visitors can enjoy hiking, golfing, swimming, fine dining, cultural activies and food on
            these islands. The islands are filled with a rich and diverse culture that is exemplified with many
            people you might meet. The Virgin Islands is simply paradise!</p>
