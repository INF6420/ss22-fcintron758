                consist of four islands. They are St. Croix, St. John, St. Thomas, and Water Island. St. Criox is the
                largest. Each island has its uniqueness that depends on what a vistor is looking for.All four islands
                are filled with crystal clear blue beaches and white sands. I live on the islands of St. Thomas. The
                capital of the Virgin Islands is Charlotte Amaile. St. Croix has two towns, Frederiksted and
                Christensted. St. John as one town, Cruz Bay. All four island have many unique and diverse activites to
