            <h1>Why These Books</h1>
            <p class="darkblue"> Many of these books became my favorites throughout my childhood and adultyears. Though there are many more, these are the few that have taught me a few lessons. Lessons in understanding of self, others, community, tolerance, life, true frendship, forgiveness,and love for self and others. Born and raised in the
                Caribbean. My love for folktales and Caribbean Literature was my first love in regards to genres. Of
                course, I was required to read classic novels in school which made me appreciate those various
                genres. I enjoyed reading books such as The Lord of the Flies, The Island of the Blue Dolphin, The
                Call of the Wild, Their Eyes Were Watching God, To Kill a Mockingbird, and many others. As I got
                older, I enjoyed autobiographies and biographies about various people. My other love is poetry. One
                of my favorite poets is Derek Wilcott. I enjoy reading his poems and his use of figurative language.
                His style is very unique. In all, I enjoy reading about different cultures and places. Learning about the life and struggles of others not only knowledge of their struggle, but the understanding. I also believe that reading
                 opens your mind to wonder, dream, and experience.</p>
